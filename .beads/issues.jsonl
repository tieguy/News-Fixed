The downloaded HTML files (e.g., FTN-315.html) only contain 118 lines and show 'You're reading the free version of Fix The News' message.\n\nCurrent behavior:\n- Files end abruptly with Firefox reader mode UI controls\n- Content stops at 'For paid subscribers this week:' with bullet points but no actual subscriber content\n- Appears to be truncated or captured before full content loads\n\nPossible causes:\n1. Reader mode (about:reader?url=...) may activate before subscriber content fully loads\n2. Reader mode may be stripping out subscriber-specific content\n3. Authentication cookies may not be properly passed to reader mode\n4. Wait times may be insufficient for full page load\n\nInvestigation needed:\n- Test fetch without reader mode to see if full content is available\n- Increase wait times before activating reader mode\n- Verify authentication status on the page before reader mode\n- Consider alternative approaches to clean HTML extraction\n\nRelated files:\n- code/src/fetch_ftn_clean.py (lines 90-100: reader mode activation)\n- data/ftn/FTN-315.html (truncated output)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-22T09:21:49.031481298-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T20:54:19.136034516-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-22T20:54:19.136034516-07:00"}

The fetch script now strips this suffix to access the paid version. We need to verify this pattern is consistent with the next issue (expected Thu Oct 23 or 24).
