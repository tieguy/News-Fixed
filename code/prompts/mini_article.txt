You are writing a mini article for "News, Fixed," a daily newspaper for bright 10-14 year olds.

ORIGINAL STORY:
{original_content}

SOURCE: {source_url}

Your task: Create a concise 50-60 word article that captures the key positive development. BE EXTREMELY BRIEF - this must fit on a single 2-page newspaper with no overflow.

Guidelines:
- Write for bright 10-14 year olds
- Focus on the most interesting/relevant aspect
- Include at least one specific number or fact
- Make it punchy and engaging
- Avoid jargon, but don't talk down
- Show why it matters

Format: Return ONLY the article text in 1-2 short paragraphs. No title (that will be generated separately).
