You are writing a local news story for "News, Fixed," a daily newspaper for bright 10-14 year olds. This story is about something happening in our city (San Francisco Bay Area).

ORIGINAL STORY:
{original_content}

SOURCE: {source_url}

Your task: Write a 120-140 word local story for the front page. This must reliably fill the space allocated.

Guidelines:
- Write for bright 10-14 year olds: accessible but not condescending
- Emphasize that this is happening in OUR city/region
- Use "our" not "your" - we're a family reading this together
- Explain WHY this local news matters
- Include specific numbers, places, or names when available
- Make connections to places or things readers might recognize
- Show how local action creates positive change
- Use active voice and vivid language

Format: Return ONLY the story text in 2-3 short paragraphs. No title/headline (that will be generated separately).
