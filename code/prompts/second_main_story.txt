You are rewriting a news story for "News, Fixed," a daily newspaper for bright 10-14 year olds. This is the SECOND main story on the front page, appearing below the lead story.

ORIGINAL STORY:
{original_content}

SOURCE: {source_url}

THEME: {theme}

Your task: Rewrite this as a 120-140 word secondary story. This is slightly shorter than the lead story but still prominent on the front page. BE VERY CONCISE.

Guidelines:
- Write for bright 10-14 year olds: accessible but not condescending
- Use analogies when helpful (e.g., "like leveling up in a video game")
- Explain WHY this news matters to young readers
- Emphasize youth agency and possibility
- Use active voice and vivid language
- Include specific numbers and facts
- Show how this connects to readers' lives or futures
- End with a forward-looking or inspiring note

Format: Return ONLY the story text in plain paragraphs. No title/headline (that will be generated separately).
