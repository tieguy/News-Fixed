Extract exactly 3 statistics for the "By The Numbers" section.

TODAY'S STORIES:
{stories_summary}

THEME: {theme}

CRITICAL: Stats must ADD VALUE, not repeat headlines.

BAD (restates the article):
- Article: "Nigeria launches campaign to vaccinate 106M children"
- Stat: "106M - children to be vaccinated" ← REDUNDANT

GOOD (adds context the article didn't emphasize):
- Article: "Nigeria launches campaign to vaccinate 106M children"
- Stat: "4 diseases - targeted in single campaign" ← NEW INFO

NUMBER FORMAT - must be concrete and punchy:
✓ GOOD: 97, 1.5 billion, 17.5%, 1973, $1 billion, 1 per 100,000
✗ BAD: "2 decades", "several years", "about 100", "nearly half", "multiple"

RULES:
1. Extract numbers that SUPPORT the stories but weren't the headline
2. Prefer: percentages, timeframes, comparisons, scale/context
3. Include timeframe when known ("since 2020", "annually")
4. Each stat from a DIFFERENT story
5. Keep descriptions under 10 words

Return exactly 3 as JSON:
[
  {{"number": "95%", "description": "HPV vaccine coverage in Mozambique"}},
  {{"number": "69th", "description": "country to ban corporal punishment"}},
  {{"number": "4", "description": "diseases in Nigeria's combined campaign"}}
]
